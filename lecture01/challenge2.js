// Coding challenge 2

/**
 * Re-create challenge 1, but this time using ES6 class.
 *
 * 2. Add a getter called 'SpeedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide by 1.6)
 *
 * 3. Add a setter called 'SpeedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but converts it to km/h before staring the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6)
 *
 * 4. Crete a new car and experiment with the accelerate and brake methods, and with the getter and setter.
 *
 * DATA CAR 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h
